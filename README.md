Hey there! üëã Looking for a Slack bot that works with OpenAI but doesn't cost a fortune? You're in the right place! This is the only OpenAI-powered Slack bot that runs on both free Slack workspaces and AWS Lambda. This package provides a streamlined framework for handling Slack events with OpenAI integration, conversation history, and thread support - all without requiring a paid Slack subscription or dedicated server infrastructure.

## üöÄ Quick Start

All you need are these three keys to get started:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-xxx
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=xxx
```

## üí° Why Choose This Bot?

Let me tell you why this bot is different from others out there:

1. **Works with Free Slack! üéâ**
   - Unlike other solutions that require Slack's paid plans, this bot works perfectly with free Slack workspaces
   - Full functionality without any paid workspace requirements
   - All core functionalities maintained on free tier

2. **True Serverless Design ‚ö°**
   - The only Slack-OpenAI bot specifically engineered for AWS Lambda
   - Eliminates the need for costly EC2 instances or self-hosting
   - Addresses all Lambda-specific challenges out of the box

3. **Using Latest OpenAI SDK**
   - Many existing solutions use outdated OpenAI versions
   - We maintain compatibility with the latest OpenAI Python SDK (v1.59.5) as much as we can.
   - Stays current with the latest LLM advancements

4. **Simple Yet Powerful üí™**
   - While there are comprehensive solutions like [@seratch's ChatGPT-in-Slack](https://github.com/seratch/ChatGPT-in-Slack) (created 2 years ago) or [chatgpt-on-deno](https://github.com/seratch/chatgpt-on-deno) from same author, who is Slack employee Kazuhiro Sera
   - They either lack updates or require Slack's framework that needs a paid plan
   - We focus on simplicity and essential text-based chat functionality

5. **Core Features Without Bloat üõ†Ô∏è**
   - Handles the most critical issue: message deduplication
   - Maintains automated testing
   - Simple enough to fork and modify
   - Available as a Python package for quick start
   - Open source and free to use (no Slack paid version required)

6. **Future-Proof & Extensible üîÆ**
   - While keeping the core simple, the project is designed to be extensible
   - Additional integrations through [MCP-Bridge](https://github.com/SecretiveShell/MCP-Bridge)
   - Supports hundreds of integrations using the same OpenAI format
